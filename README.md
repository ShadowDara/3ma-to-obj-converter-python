3d modeling app 3ma to obj converter

HOW TO USE:
    
1. Find a way to put your 3ma file in a device that can run python
2. Change the file type of your 3ma file to json
3. Specify the filepath+filename of your 3ma file on line 23 of this python script (filepaths require double forward slashes \\)
4. Specify the filepath+filename of your obj file on line 29 of this python script. Make sure you include the .obj file extension
5. Run this script (takes about 1 sec or less. If it took 5 secs or more let me know and let me see your 3d model!)
6. ENJOY!
